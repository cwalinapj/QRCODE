# FAQ

## Why USDC only?

USDC-only pricing keeps mint costs predictable and avoids token-volatility confusion.

## Can I pay with POL/MATIC?

Not in MVP. POL/MATIC support is intentionally out of scope.

## Can immutable records be edited by admin?

No. Immutable records cannot be changed by anyone.

## What if I lose my wallet?

For updateable records, control follows token ownership. If your wallet is lost and unrecoverable, updates are not possible.

## Roadmap

- Monitoring/alerts for updateable records
- Analytics dashboards
- Additional L2 support
